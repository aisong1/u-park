# WePark
This is WePark - the one-stop-shop application that allows you to track available parking spaces in the Greater Seattle Area. 

Have plans Downtown but you're worried that you'll spend hours looking for a parking space? We've all been there. 

But never fear - WePark is here! 

Built with React (Hooks), NodeJS Express, CSS Modules, Mapbox, and PostgreSQL.
## Demo
Create an account, or login into an existing one, and watch as all available parking meters not currently in use will show up on an interactive map. Explore different areas with a click-and-drag, or type in an address of your own to see nearby available meters! 

Have a parking meter you like to frequent? Add to your favorites list, conveniently displayed on the left hand side of the map - click one, and be "flown over" to that parking meter on the map!
